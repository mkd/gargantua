// evaluate
//
// This evaluation function gives an absolute value with the current position
// evaluation, taking into account both material and positional play. 
//
// The value returned by eval already contains a negative sign (-) for a
// winning score for Black, whereas a positive score means White is better.
//
// Note: this evaluation function solely relies on a neural network (NNUE file)
// that has been trained with hundreds of millions of positions at moderate
// depth using Stockfish.
int evaluate()

    // This function ends up calling the nnue_evaluate() function:
    //
    // nnue_evaluate() takes three arguments:
    //
    // 1. (int)   side to move -- white=0, black=1
    // 2. (int *) array of pieces
    // 3. (int *)  array of squares each piece stands on
    //
    //
    // Piece codes are:
    //      wking=1, wqueen=2, wrook=3, wbishop= 4, wknight= 5, wpawn= 6,
    //      bking=7, bqueen=8, brook=9, bbishop=10, bknight=11, bpawn=12,
    //
    // Squares are:
    //      A1=0, B1=1 ... H8=63
    //
    // Input format:
    //      piece[0] is white king, square[0] is its location
    //      piece[1] is black king, square[1] is its location
    //      ..
    //      piece[x], square[x] can be in any order
    //      ..
    //      piece[n+1] is set to 0 to represent end of array
    //
    // Returns the score relative to side to move in approximate centi-pawns.
